## 🧩 Requirements from the course
- Follow the provided **design spec (Figma)**  
- Generate all conversions when the user clicks **“Convert”**  
- Round the numbers down to **three decimal places**  
- Reinforce **JavaScript fundamentals** with clean, reusable functions  

---

## 🧠 What I learned
Through this project I practiced and reinforced:
- Creating **pure functions** for mathematical conversions  
- Using **objects as return values** to organize multiple results  
- Passing data through **parameters** and managing **function scope**  
- Updating the DOM dynamically using **`textContent`** (instead of `innerHTML`)  
- Structuring and styling with **clean, consistent CSS**  
- Improving **HTML accessibility** with semantic tags and ARIA labels  
- Replacing Vite setup with a **simple static deployment** for easier hosting

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript

## ⚙️ Features
- ✅ Converts **Length (Meters ↔ Feet)**  
- ✅ Converts **Volume (Liters ↔ Gallons)**  
- ✅ Converts **Mass (Kilograms ↔ Pounds)**  
- ✅ All conversions trigger with one button click  
- ✅ Numbers rounded to three decimal places  
- ✅ Accessible input field for screen readers (`label`, `aria-label`, `type="number"`)  
- ✅ Fully responsive and faithful to Scrimba’s Figma design

## ♿ Accessibility Improvements
This project includes basic accessibility best practices:
- `type="number"` for numeric-only input and mobile keyboard support  
- `label for="input-el"` linked to input field  
- `.sr-only` class added to make labels readable by screen readers only  
- `aria-label` describing input purpose (“unit value to convert”)
- Visible focus state on button for keyboard navigation  

```html
<label for="input-el" class="sr-only">Enter a number to convert</label>
<input type="number" id="input-el" aria-label="unit value to convert" />
```
